# auto-oceanhearo
This program automatically simulates searches on [OceanHero](https://oceanhero.today).

It was used to get over half a million searchs in the span of 15 hours and placed our school very firmly at the top of the search leaderboard. 

Note: This code is broken now as OceanHero added safeguards against it. Don't try to use it. Also, this is kinda a scummy thing to do in the first place as OceanHero doesn't make any ad revenue off bots mass searching the word "test".
